			<h3>3 Website Reviews</h3>

			<h4>Netflix</h4>

			<p>This is one of my favorite websites, because I love movies - a bit biased.   However, I do think that it is well laid out.  I like that categories are as a list on the top toolbar, as well as visually down the page.</p>

			<p>My eye is immediately drawn to the "Movie Icons." and then the category breakdown.  From a greater distance, my eye is drawn to the red bar at the top.  There is substantial information here, however the "Movie Icons" are very important.</p>

			<p>This website is clean, clear, organized, attractive, and simple.</p>

			<p>This site helps me pick some entertainment for the evening.  It carries Gendres, "Movie Icons", and descriptions.</p>

			<p>This site is very practical, fun, pleasing, orderly, and clear.  They are very similar.</p>

			<p>Searching for information is very easy and this has been accomplished through the layout of the page.</p>

			<p>It is quite easy to browse through the content.  It would be nice to see all of the movies available.</p>

			<p>The site has enough to look over that I am always moving forward.  However, sometimes I realize the quality of movies on average and end up feeling like I am wasting my time.</p>

			<p>It requires a monthly fee to view movies.</p>

			<h4>w3schools</h4>

			<p>I really like how the information is sequential.  I also like that you can click a button and go to an internal text-editor where you can experiment.</p>


			<p>My eye is most drawn to the sidebar and the color picker.  Standing back, my eye is drawn to the companies Logo.  This does not help me use their site, however this is important for them to be able to brand and run a business.  This might ultimately help the user.</p>

			<p>This website is clean, organized, simple, elegant, and straight forward.</p>

			<p>The site helps people learn specific coding skills.  It has tons of content regarding coding in various languages.</p>

			<p>This site is very practical, simple, straight forward, useful, and clean.  They are much the same.</p>

			<p>Searching for information is quite easy.  The site almost leads you on.</p>

			<p>It is very easy to browse through the content, due to the very nice linear layout.</p>

			<p>The site is not visually entertaining, however, the content is so well organized that this is not a factor for me.</p>

			<p>The site sells Web Certifications.  I have not purchased any of these.</p>

			<h4>Yahoo Mail</h4>

			<p>I like the layout for the mail, however it was also the first email service that I had - comfort.  I picked this site because I am impressed by effectiveness of their front-page.  I am almost always in a hurry to get work done, but when I go to log onto my email and the front-page pops up with all of the news articles, sports, celebrities, etc, I find myself hooked and clicking on one of the articles before I know it (For me to be drawn off task requires quite a bit.)</p>

			<p>My eye is draw to the photo in the upper middle of the page.  Standing back, my eye is drawn to the little symbol to click on to check my mail.</p>
			
			<p>This site is visually attractive, clean, engaging, simple, packed.</p>

			<p>This site is the gateway to my email.  It contains all of the information just mentioned and more.</p>

			<p>This site is very straight forward, easy to use, intuitive, engaging, and clean.</p>

			<p>It is very easy.  All of the information is well labeled and well positioned.</p>

			<p>As a result of it clean and simple structure, the totality of the content is easy to take in.</p>

			<p>After looking at a few articles and photos, I normally realize that I need to get to work and was not successful this morning at simply clicking straight through to my emails.</p>

			<p>The site does not appear to directly sell anything.  However, there are links to sites that do.  I have not purchased any of these.</p>
