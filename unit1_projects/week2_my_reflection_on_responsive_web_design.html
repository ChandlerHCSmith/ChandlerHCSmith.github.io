			<p id="minor_headings">What is responsive web design? Do you like it? Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?</p>

			<p>Responsive Web Design involves the desire to make a website look it best on all devices.  When a device searchs the Web, the program at the other end check what size the devices display is and modifies not only the size varies elements of the page, but quite often changes the actual content itself.</p>

			<p>I really like the idea and see the results as pleasing to the eye and beneficial to the message of the site.</p>

			<p>I do think that it is a good practice.  The information is modified with a purpose.  The purpose is for the "message" of the site to still be conveyed even when the proportions of the page change.</p>  

			<p id="minor_headings">How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</p>
			<p>Smartphones and tablets both changed the size of the display.  This brought a demand for the layout to change to carry the "right look" the correct "message/purpose."  I also think that with smartphones and tablets being devices largely utilized by people on the go, sites probably changed to reflect the new mind set of the user.</p>

			<p>Referring to new technologies.  If we do start wearing glasses that have displays, they will need to modify based on the environment of the user.</p>


			<p id="minor_headings">How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</p>

			<p>I have known 3 people who use the internet who are sight impaired and one person who is blind.  Being able to zoom is useful.  Being able to choose font and image size is super useful.  The man that I knew who was blind had a Text-to-Speech program that read webpages outloud.  Really cool!</p>

			<p>Again, content decisions could be very useful or limiting.  I think that I would like the option to have the site "thinned" to help me access or to still have all of the content and have other modifications made.</p>

			<p id="minor_headings">What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</p>

			<p>I really like the change of content to create affective webpages depending on the size of the screen.  In general it made sense after a very short explanation.  However, I had a long learning curve on why certain parts following the @media screen and (max-width: value) would be choosen.  I understand it much better now, however, any work that I did on modifing the practice exercise feels like I have in essence copied the code, instead of thinking it up myself.  Therefore I modified different portions of the code to show that I now understand what they are doing.</p>
