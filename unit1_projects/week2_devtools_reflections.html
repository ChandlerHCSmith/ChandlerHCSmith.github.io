  			<h3> Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?</h3> 
  				<p>I liked the visual presentation.</p>
  				<p>I liked that all objects were represented as a "tree."  When one was clicked on they all are represented by the CSS that is directly applied and inherited.</p>
  				<p>I also liked being able to direct/immediate changes.  I also liked that it showed the box around elements.</p>


  			<h3>How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?</h3>
  				<p>The wordpress.com site had quite a bit of javascript and some other code.</p>

  			<h3>Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?</h3> 
  				<p>I really liked Chrome Web Tools.  Again, I really liked seeing the site immediately change, the boxes around elements.  I liked that it isolated the code.  I liked that it showed inherited code.  I felt like I was learning at the same time that I was using the tool.  Very cool!</p>


			<h3>Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?</h3>
				<p>I was able to see several CSS modifications that other sites used that I think will be useful in the future.</p>


			<h3>Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.</h3>
				<p>I looked up DOM on Wikipedia: URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model</p>
				<p>I also liked: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_Reference/Introduction</p>
				<p>I also looked over several other sites and gained information, but none of them struck me as a continued resource.</p>
