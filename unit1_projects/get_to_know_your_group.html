				<h3><b>Email sent to Group:</b></h3>
				<p>Hi DBC Accountability Fellow-members,</p>
				<p>My name is Chandler Smith.</p>
				<p>Sorry for the late start.  Wasn't able to attend Intro-Session, the reschedule was yesterday, and wasn't assigned to an Accountability Group.</p>

				<p>I had all of Week_1 work accomplished last Sunday.  Working on Week_2 right now.</p>

				<p>My learning style is multimodal.</p>

				<p>I plan on going to work, spending time with my family, and spending time each day on completing Phase_0 work, as well as continuing to learn coding through additional sites.</p>

				<p>I love w3schools as a coding site.  I love DevTools!</p>

				<p>I love NetFlix as a great example of good layout with B quality movies... :)</p>

				<p>I am currently in Capistrano Beach, CA.</p>

				<p>I look forward to working with all of you!</p>


				<p>Sincerely,</p>

				<p>Chandler</p>

			<h3>Reflections</h3>
			<p id="question">Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC.</p>
			<p>I found it awesome that most people felt free to share their fears so openly.  After reading a few, I thought, "Wow, these are some really neat people!  These are really relatable people.  I am looking forward to working with them!"<p>
			<p id="question">How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together?</p>
			<p>I felt better.  It is always nice to know that you are in a group of people that can relate.</p>
			<p id="question">How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.</p>
			<p>I know that together we are stronger.</p>
			<p>I know that together we can succeed.</p>
