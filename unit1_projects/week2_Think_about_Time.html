			<p id="minor_headings">What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?</p>

			<p>I actually do pretty well with time management, however I work during the day and I work asynchronously for a university - this means I am almost always on.</p>  

			<p>I go to work each day until 5:00.  I get home around 5:15 - short commute time is awesome!  I jump on the computer.  I then eat dinner with the family.  I then check up on my uni-students.  I then jump back on the computer.  I can stay focused on a topic for long periods of time.  Truthfully, I am having the hardest time with all of the, for me, new ins-n-outs of all the new accessories: +Google, Communities, Hangouts, Pairing, GPS, GitHub(did I only synch it to myself or also share it with the instructors.)</p>


			<p id="minor_headings">How will you combat that?</p>
			<p>I will succeed by never giving up, by working with others, and by taking the necessary time to relax and regroup.</p>


			<p id="minor_headings">What techniques will you try?</p>

			<p>When I hit a wall, I find that getting up and walking around and thinking through the problem helps.  I think the physical break as well as the actual walking helps shift gears in my mind.</p>
			<p>I also find that reading something challenging, but non-Program related, like Philosophy, helps me "recenter/relax".  I think that this is because it requires me to stop.</p>
			<p>Physical excerise is very helpful.  I am more productive.</p>


			<p id="minor_headings">What is your overall plan for Phase 0?</p>
			<p>Work, Program, Family, Program, Individual Non-program time.</p>
			<p>Just keep swimming... :)</p>
