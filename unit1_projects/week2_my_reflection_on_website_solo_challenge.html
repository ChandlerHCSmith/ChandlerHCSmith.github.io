			<p>file:///Users/ChandlerHCSmith/Desktop/test/index.html</p>  

			<p id="minor_headings">What did you learn about design and user experience?</p>
			<p>It is very important to create a website that is an experience for the user.  This experience can be temporary and therefore not long term very valuable.  There needs to be a clear purpose and outcome desired before a website is designed to optimize functionality.</p>


			<p id="minor_headings">Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)</p>

			<p>I enjoy wireframing and design.  I really like think about what the intended audience will get out of their interaction with a book, a website, a movie, etc.  I am really disappointed that I could not get my 3 columna to work.  I think the user experience would have been much greater if I had all three intended columns.</p>

			<p id="minor_headings">What was your process? What worked and didn't work?</p>
			<p>First I tried to decide what the website's main point should be as a gateway to all of my other work.  I viewed index.html the way I have seen it used over and over again, as the home page.  I tried to visual an overall look to the site - there is still so much I want to learn and show everyone.  I tried wireframing, but I found it limiting.  So I went in the backyard and sat on a deck chair.  I tried to just let my mind go.  I then visualized the page and did the wireframing second and then coded the site.</p>

			<p id="minor_headings">What would you like to add or change about the site next?</p>
			<p>I really wanted the third column to line up and work.  It contains the connection to all of my work and I think that people would see the purpose of the site very quickly if they could see these links immediately before scrolling down.  I like to add a Boot to the header after my title.</p>

			<p id="minor_headings">Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?</p>
			<p>I really enjoyed applying the information that I have learned and making a site that looks a little more contemporary compared to this site that looks very "old-school".  I learned a lot by studying other sites using DevTools Chrome and learning how they handled flow.  I still need to learn more.</p>

			<p id="minor_headings">Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.</p>
