		<h3>A.  What was this experience like?</h3>
		<p>I found it to be quite different not having a finger in each piece of the pie.  It was mostly a relief knowing that I was working this out with others and that I had a very specific part of the puzzle.</p>

		<h3>B.  Was your group successful in passing the tests?</h3>
		<p>We were successful.  Still awaiting the last step in the sequence, but time draws nigh.</p>

		<h3>C.  What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring, etc.?<h3>
		<p>The code that was handed to me was already very well written.  There were only a couple very minor syntax issues.</p>
		<p>I enjoyed writing the user stories by interpreting the purpose of the code and its output.</p>

      	<h3>1.  What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?<h3>
      	<p>I moved information through the code to see if it worked and then looked for any ways to reduce the amount of code.  This seemed to really make me productive.</p>

      	<h3>2.  What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
      	<p>I really didn't have any questions other than reading through the code and making sure that it worked and looking for logical repeats of code.</p>

	    <h3>3.  What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?</h3>
	    <p>This process did not seem too difficult.  I feel like I was successful.</p>

	    <h3>4.  Did you learn any new skills or tricks?</h3>
	    <p>I felt more that skills I have and knowledge I have was solidified.</p>

	    <h3>5.  How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h3>
		<p>I am quite confident of this portion of JavaScript.</p>

	    <h3>6.  Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?</h3>
		<p>I really enjoyed looking through the code to see if it worked and to look for places to reduce/refactor.  I also enjoyed writing the user story.</p>
	      
	    <h3>7.  Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</h3>
	    <p>I did not find any of it tedious.</p>
