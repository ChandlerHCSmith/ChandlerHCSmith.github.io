		<h3>Q&A after some Research on my style:</h3>
		<h3>How can understanding my style help me have an advantage at DBC?</h3>

		<p>I know that I like to understand why things work, but it is by far not a must.  I know that I enjoy have reading references and expert sources, but quite often have to create these myself.  I also know that relationships are very dear to me.  I also know that I can go with the flow as well as be a stick in the mud at times.</p> 

		<p>I think that just recognizing my tendencies and seeing those pools of tendencies in others will really help me know how to interact with others, getting what we both need, while having empathy and appreciation for their processing.</p> 

		<p>I think it will also reduce stress to see myself through this lens and know that I behave differently than others.  That this is okay and we all have something unique to contribute - seeing value in another person's approach.</p>  

		<h3>Considering my experience in Phase 0 to this point:</h3>

		<h4>What has been the biggest struggle for you?</h4>

		<p>So far I have struggled the most with the geography if you will of all of the new programs we are using.  Certain programs seem intuitive and others I have to continually remind myself of where the Google Hangouts is located.  These seem very small, but they ate up quite a bit of time at first.

		<h4>Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else.</h4>

		<p>It is possibly related.  A more random person might have the prior skills to pick these things up faster.  They may be less bothered by them.</p>

		<h4>If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you.</h4>

		<p>I know that I have started to be more circular in my workflow.  I tend to accomplish specific chunks of work all at once in their entirety.   has become clear to me that placing each objective into subdivisions and looking at the time I have before a Peer-Pairing Session and seeing which subdivision is approachable has really increased my workflow/output and cut down on time.</p>

		<h3>Plan of action:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>I need to continue subdividing Objectives.</li>
				<li>I need to reach out to people more often (sometimes to ask questions, but really to build a team.).</li>
					<ol>
						<li>*I haven't reached out as much simply because I am occupied with accomplishing the tasks.</li>
						<li>However, I find that the interactions and input causes a big leap in my productivity.</li>
					</ol>
				<li>I need to continue honing my time management skills.  I don't waste time by being lazy or procrastinating, but rather by thinking about an aspect of another/currently unrelated challenge in between moves.</li>
				<li>I need to focus more sharply on each Release, instead of seeing how they all relate to each, when they tend to simply build on each other.</li>
			</ol>
