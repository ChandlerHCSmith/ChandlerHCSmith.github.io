"Git" Started

// Learning Competencies

// Use git commands in the terminal
// Fetch changes from a forked repository
// Push and pull your own changes between your local and remote repositories

----------Release 0: Install Git---------------------------------------
//	Already had installed Git.  I was reading through some of the Michael Hartl book.  Haven't finished yet.


----------Release 1: Research---------------------------------------
//	Done for now.  Definitely could go deeper.


----------Release 2: Basic Git Commands--------------------------------

Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.

//add
//	Adds files to branches so they can be tracked and utilized.  Initially they are added to the staging area.

//branch
//	A copy of your code that you can "move along side", work on, and make separate committs..  Once done, your 
// 		new code wasn't really useful and you reset or remove.  Or you can merge changes back into the master branch.	

//checkout
//	This is used to switch branches.

//clone
//	Creates an identical copy of a repository in a new respository.

//commit
//	Creates a history of changes.  This allows you to journey back in time.  Be sure to committ often.  
//	Leave yourself lots of sign posts.
//	 

//fetch
//	Graps materials from another repository.

//log
//	Shows a history of committs to help us make decisions and remember changes.

//merge
//	This takes changes that we have created on another branch and puts them into the original branch.

//pull
//	This takes other contributor's changes and we pull them into our original project.

//push
//	Tells Git where to put our committs
//	git push -u origin master (origin is the remote and our local branch is named master)

//	git push -u origin master

//reset
//	This allows us to unstage files.

//rm
//	Removes files from a given repository.  This will also stage the removal to make this thorough.

//status
//	Tells us where a file is located and when/what the last committ was.

----------Release 3: Use Git-------------------------------------

//	I practiced.


----------Release 4: Git Workflow--------------------------------

// Push files to a remote repository
//		general form: git push [alias] [branch] 
//		specific ex:  git push githubdevbootcamp phase_0_projects

// Fetch changes
//		general form: git fetch github
//		specific ex:  git fetch githubdevbootcamp

// Commit locally (stage first with git add)
//		ex:  git commit -m 'Records player's moves'



----------Release 5: Reflection----------------------------------

// Reflection Guidelines
// When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking.

// Remember, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

// Answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

//1) What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
//	I have the need to practice.  I am still not satisfied with my understanding of GitHub Workflow.
//   I feel that I understand, for the most part, the overall flow.  I need to pratice, practice, practice the terminology and techniques.
	// -	I create some work.
	// -	I create a respository for this work.
	// - 	I place my work in this repository.
	// -	I commit and then synch/push.
	// -	I do work and commit (This keeps a history.)
	// -	Others can join.
	// - 	Others can add work.
	// -	Others create a branch of their own to work on.
	// -	Commits are made frequently to leave time markers.
	// -	We can put all of our work together.
	// - 	I will call a friend of mine who I know can explain this and clear things up.

//2) What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

//	Here are some resources that I utilized:

// https://try.github.io
// https://github.com/
// http://gitref.org/basic/


//3) What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
		// -	Again, I think the overall idea at this level makes sense.
		// -	GitHub allows several versions of the same project to be worked on.
		// -	GitHub allows us to keep track of these different pieces.
		// - 	GitHub allows us to delete pieces, add pieces/sources, merge.
		// *	I really think that working with GitHub will make the process clear.

//4) Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
		// I know some of the terms and commands, but not fluently.

//5) How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
		// I need repetition/practice.

//6) Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
		// I find it rewarding to understand systems, especially one's I need to know.  I like very much the idea
		//		that versions of past work have been saved.
		// I like very much that colaboration at this level is already here.

//7) Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
		// I just need to practice the commands.  I enjoyed the tasks.
