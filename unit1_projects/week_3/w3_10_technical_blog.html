		<h1>JavaScript, all the Rage Among Web Developers</h1>

		<h2>Why is JavaScript (JS) so popular in web development?</h2>

		<img src="images/building_websites.jpeg" alt="Construction Style Website Title Image">

		<h3>Background</h3>

		<p>First, I think it is useful to understand JavaScript's position in the Web World.  At first web pages were on the intranet and they conveyed scientific research.</p>

		<a href="http://info.cern.ch">Link to the first web site: CERN</a>

		<p>After a while this expanded to include more organizations and the eventually the Internet was born.</p>

		<p>Originally, web page were amazing because they had never been done before.  Plus who won't want their authored work to be up in lights and that it was.</p>

		<p>However, after awhile, just "looking" at people's authored work wasn't somehow enough.  It just sat there, it didn't do anything.  You couldn't interact with it.  It was Static and people wanted Dynamic, Interactivity, and the ability to connect with the fancy pixel'd world.</p>

		<h3>JavaScript(JS): A Dynamic World replaces A Static World.</h3>  

		<p>However, why is JavaScript instead of (python, C#, visual basic, PHP, Perl, just to mention a few) so popular among web developers when these other languages add motion, interaction, and functionality?</p>

		<h3>Some Possible Reasons:</h3>
			<ol>
			<li>It is designed with an object-oriented structure in mind.  HTML is this type of language.  In short, this means that JS fits well with the overall construction and logic and design of HTML.  When you look at a webpage, all of the "pieces", the Title, Photos, Logos, Headings, Text, Buttons, Areas to add information, Borders are all called objects.</li>
			<li>It is powerful (but so are other languages.)</li>
			<li>It can directly be added to your webpage.  I mean directly.  Yeah, sure you need to put in a link to your JavaScript, but you don't need any fancy extras like access to a server or compiling programs.</li>
			<li>The large number of people who currently run browsers, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc that all support/work-with JavaScript is in the millions.  This helps the user experience to be satisfying with sites which utilize JavaScript.</li>
			<li>The language has continued to grow and people who program aren't constantly running into limitations large enough to move them in favor of other languages.</li>
			<li>It does not need to send messages back and forth between your computer and a server somewhere.  JavaScript allows for a large number of these interactions to occur on what is called the client-side, this typically is your computer.  This allows leaves the server free for other interactions.</li>
			<li>The "friendliness" on the server-side has increased in a fashion that even more people are utilizing the power of JavaScript.</li>
				</ol>
