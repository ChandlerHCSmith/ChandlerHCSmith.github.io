			<p id="minor_headings">PICK A VALUE</p>
			<p>Close relationships:  This seems to be the glue that binds us together.  I am the happiest, most proud, and the most satisfied, be that at work, during travel, or at home, when my close relationships are strong.  I also find that a very similar feeling and result comes from <i>Cooperation</i>, <i>Honesty</i>, <i>Helping other people</i>, and <i>Wisdom.</i></p>


			<p id="minor_headings">LIVING UP TO</p>
			<p>In general, I try to live up to these values:

			<p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 --<span id="red">---</span><span id="red_large"> 5</span> Agree</p>


			<p id="minor_headings">ADVICE</p>
			<p>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</p>
			<p>I was asked by a youngman whether he should follow his father's wishes or his own.  In some respects this was a hard one.  It required much discussion and investigation.  I asked him many questions to see where he thought his father was coming from?  I asked him what partial conclusions he had come to?  I then related events in my life in which I thought one thing and then later realized that my father was correct.  I also passed on some examples in which my father has told me that maybe his methods, although well intended, may not have been the best.</p>
