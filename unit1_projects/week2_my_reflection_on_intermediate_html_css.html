			<p id="minor_headings">What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?</p>

			<p>It seems like a good idea that we are all work on the same page.  I know that in some ways this can limit creativity, however, from what I've seen on the web, there will continue to be break throughs and modifications.</p>  




			<p id="minor_headings">Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?</p>
			<p>They do seem to make sense to me.  I like a set of items to follow and then we add personal touches.  So, I guess I am saying that I still want some freedom.</p>


			<p id="minor_headings">Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as <code>&lt;header></code>, <code>&lt;footer></code>, and <code>&lt;nav></code>? Why or why not?</p>

			<p>They seem very clean to me and this seems nice at this point.  Maybe I would a different view if I already had been programming for awhile.</p>



			<p id="minor_headings">Why is reset.css necessary?</p>
			<p>Reset, resets the browsers default to make way for your specifications.</p>



			<p id="minor_headings">What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?</p>
			<p>Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.  Yes, I have noticed that the placement of elements are different and sometimes the look of an element will be changed.  On occasions, there are pieces even missing, although this is rare.</p>

			<p>In these cases I was the "consumer" and would have liked uniformity to help me spend less time looking for items.</p>

			<p id="minor_headings">Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.</p>
			<p>I really like: http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</p>
