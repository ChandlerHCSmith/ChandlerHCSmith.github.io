		<h2>Costa Rica</h2>

		<div id="text">
			<p>The webpage is helping people plan their vacation destination.  The page presents photographs and descriptions of potential destinations.  This helps the traveller to shape their thoughts.  From here the traveller is able to seek out Hotels/Vacation Rentals, Flights, and Activities.</p>
			<p>As to visual challenges.  The toolbar is nicely done.  It is big enough to see clearly.  I am sure that the photo-real-estate is prime.  The designer needs people to be able to see clearly the photos, and at the same time keep them focused that there are places to go and things to see and a toolbar above to help get you to the things you want.</p>

		<h2>Prague</h2>

		<div id="text">
			<p>This webpage attempts to be many things.  It has as its goal, not only tourism, but a sense of carrying the pride of the Czech people as well.  When looking in the upper righthand corner it is clear that the site has been designed to cater to people from several different places.  When looking through most of the site, it has qutie a bit to offer.  It contains quite a bit of detail.  This almost makes up for what is, to me, not the most attractive layout.  Possibly, if I were to look at more multicultural sites, I would find that this layout is very affective.  If we were to conduct some research related to layouts and had a way for the public to rate the site's appeal we could come to a better understanding.</p>
			<p>As to visual challenges.  I don't much like the fact that it does not use the entire screen for my laptop.  It would also be nice to have some visuals sprinkled into the the text regarding historic events.</p>
