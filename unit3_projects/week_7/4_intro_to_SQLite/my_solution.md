## Release 2: Multi-line commands

The email column was marked UNIQUE NOT NULL.  This keeps people from entering any new data that has this same email address.


## Release 3: Add a column

## Release 5: Reflect

How to Reflect
Reflecting is an incredibly important part of the learning process. It requires you to take a moment and think about what you've learned, what is confusing, and where you need to go. They document your learning process.

Reflections are mandatory for each challenge.

When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking.

Remember, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates to learn from, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

1)  What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?

For the most part this was just an introduction.  So, following the instructions was most helpful.  I also immediately researched how to accomplish adding a column and updating.

2)  What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I found Office Dev Center to be clear and useful (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb243852(v=office.12).aspx).     

3)  What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

These seemed to be fairly basic and easy.

4)  Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I enjoyed making making tables and using CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, DATETIME('now'), UPDATE, and SET.     

5)  How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I would place my condidence as an 8 and would like to practice more.

6)  Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
  
I really enjoyed all of it.  It was fun to create tables that seemed to appear out of thin air - cool.	  

7)  Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I enjoyed all of this challenge.
