		<h3>SQL, a bit of History</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">This system of storing data and handling data was designing in the 1970's.  It was mostly used by scientist, engineers, architects, and accountants.  As time moved forward our databases increased in size and our ability to manipulate data became harder unless we were going after one specific item.  Cross referencing items and the size of storage is quite large for SQL databases.</p>

		<h3>SQL, their characteristics (advantages and disadvantages)</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">SQL databases store data based on relationships between fields of data.  They also have a clear, however set structure called schema.  With the increase in interactivity of websites, came a difficult for SQL databases.  Many times for them to be updated, the require a certain amount of down time.  This cause problems when interacting with the Web.  Due to the architecture of SQL databases more assumptions are incorporated into their structure from "birth".  These assumption can have profound affects on how code interacts with the databases elements.</p> 

		<p id="body_paragraphs">SQL is also a declarative language, this means that queries specify what information needs to be retrieved, however it does not give the method in which to retrieve this information.  In many cases the original query does not accomplish the goal and clever code must be thought up in an attempt to navigate and retrieve said information.</p>

		<h3>NoSQL, their characteristics (advantages and disadvantages)</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">NoSQL databases do not have as rigid a structure and do not rely on the relational approach.  They are more flexible and this makes updating and interactivity faster and more synchronized with user interactivity.  This also allows them more area for increased functionality.  NoSQL makes less assumptions on what a query means.  You are also allowed to abandon SELECT as the main method.</p>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">One downside, they are new and therefore lack much of the user interface features that we enjoy with SQL. </p>

		<h3>A prediction</h3>

		<p id="definition" id="body_paragraphs">""NoSQL engines will change - into 'NearlySQL'", Alaric Snell-Pym, Genie DB Chief Architect"1</p>

		<h3>Preference</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">I am interested in both.  At the moment I do not know enough about these databases and how they could benefit a customer that I want to know more.  I like the structure of the SQL and I like the potential of the openness of the NoSQL.  I think that knowing both would be best.</p>

		<h3>XKCD comic</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">The <a href="http://xkcd.com/327/">XKCD comic</a> is quite entertaining.  People working with a database shouldn't be able to carry out destructive procedures so easily/by accident.  In addition, all data should be filtered for information which replicates query commands.  As for a newb programmer.  They must have backup copies of the databases that they are working on.  They must also be vigilant regarding which commands they enter.</p>

		<h3>SQL Injection</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">This involves introducing input into the SQL query that is not sanitized.  This means that it carries extra information that the SQL does not know how to handle.  It normally recognizes this information as the natural breaking point or a truncation.</p>

		<h3>Millions of entries an Optimization</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">In most cases, the programming will be working with vast amounts of information.  The best way to deal with such a large quantity is to cut it up into smaller, more manageable pieces.  This is where foreign keys and connections becomes so important.  However, before you go off slicing' 'n dicin', it is important to understand how the company operates.  What data is accessed most often and how does data "flow".  With this, the programmer can make decisions on how to separate the data in ways that will create the least number of cross references.</p>
