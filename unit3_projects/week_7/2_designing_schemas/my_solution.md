# U3.W7: Designing Schemas


#### I worked on this challenge [by myself]


## Release 0: Student Roster Schema

## Release 3: Many to Many Schema

## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 

One-to-One:
  Every driver has a unique driver license number and this number is linked to that person's driving record.

  Many of the contributions to science are collaborative.  This means that each scientist is attached to the contribution to science.  Each scientist also contributes to many experiments and discoveries.  Each discovery is therefore linked to several scientist.  This is true of scientific articles as well, so I added another table of scientific articles.  Now, I am not sure that this model is always true.  I would expect that some publications are by a single author/scientist and that some discoveries are made by solo scientists as well.  However, it is a decent model.

## Release 5: Reflection

How to Reflect
Reflecting is an incredibly important part of the learning process. It requires you to take a moment and think about what you've learned, what is confusing, and where you need to go. They document your learning process.

Reflections are mandatory for each challenge.

When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking.

Remember, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates to learn from, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

1)  What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?

I enjoyed working with the different schema.  I enjoyed working with SQL Designer.  I had to research the flow with primaray keys.  The idea is fairly simple, except the presentation of tables in a single column/field is different for me at present.      

2)  What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I really questioned if I was seeing the flow/connection between tables correctly.  I think that I am, however, I will want to chart/map this relation out using some charts.  

3)  What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

 This is the same as number 2)  

4)  Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

The idea of a primary key connecting everthing together made sense.  I think I gained the most, and still have so much room to grow in, by thinking of how to link datatables so that there is the least amount of repeat.

5)  How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I believe that I understand the main/core ideas stongly.  I did want to double check my process/order of clicking fields to make connections between fields.     
6)  Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

Again, I really like the puzzle/logic challenge.  I also liked the graphic display.

7)  Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I really wanted to copy fields for use in other tables.  Knowing that this might be an option and that it would really make sense, bugged me a bit.
