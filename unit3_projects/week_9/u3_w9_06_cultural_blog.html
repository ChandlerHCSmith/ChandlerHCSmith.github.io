		<p id="body_paragraphs">Thinking and learning styles, although abstract in appearance, have a large and tangible effect on all areas of our lives.  They paint the world around us in very specific ways.  This creates a "lens" through which we view the world.  These styles of thinking can be leveraged to our advantage and they can also be stumbling blocks.  They affect not only how we think and learn, but also how we interact with those around us. </p>

		<h3>Summary of My Thinking Style Results:</h3>

		<h3>Personal Thinking Style</h3>

		<p>Concrete Sequential (CS)	6x4 = 24</p>

		<p>Abstract Sequential (AS)	11x4 = 44</p>

		<p>Abstract Random (AR)	9x4 = 36</p>

		<p>Concrete Random (CR)	4x4 = 16</p>

		<h3>Learning Preference</h3>  

		<p id="body_paragraph">I scored the highest on Abstract Random and Abstract Sequential.  People with these two styles tend to thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.  We also organize information through reflection, and love the world of theory and abstract thought.  There is a strong desire to seek out authoritative materials and experts, to "know" the right answers.  They also love to do research and mull an idea over and over again in their minds until it is fully known.  They like to see an idea for what it is - from all angles.  They like to fully-understand an idea.  They love to work with others, to gain different perspectives while looking for the "ultimate" perspective.  They enjoy being artistic and connecting with others while finding a "better" way.</p>

		<h3>Summary of My Learning Style Results:</h3>
		<h4>VARK  (multimodal) learning preference</h4>

		<p>Visual:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12</p>
		<p>Aural:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10</p>
		<p>Read/Write:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</p>
		<p>Kinesthetic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8</p>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">I am a multimodal learner - this does not surprise me.  I see the four main methods of pulling in information as fairly equal and enjoy using all four.</p>

		<h3>Expanding Ways of Learning and Thinking</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">One amazing aspect of our minds is how malleable and plastic it can be.  If we work in our strengths and in our weaknesses, we find that both areas are strengthened and new neural pathways are formed.  I have been working on gathering other people's ways of processing and tackling a challenge and see if I can do the same.  If one person is really good at looking up information on stackoverflow, then I have been asking myself, "In what ways do they think differently that I could gain by."  I have also found myself Googling more than I did before.   This approach will greatly benefit me at DBC, since I will be constantly working with others.  I will need to depend on the flexibility and enjoy it growth so that I can gain and contribute the most.</p>

		<h3>My Phase 0 Struggles</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">I have rather enjoyed all of the challenges, however this is not to say that I have been struggle-free.  My greatest struggles have come from how I operate.  I have always been able to eventually solve problems just by thinking.  I know how this sounds, but it is true.  Of course, I had a book to study, notes from class, and hours to sit and contemplate, draw diagrams, and rethink, and then retool, etc.  I also have a very long attention span and can tolerate a fair amount of confusion.  This was a very successful method.  All of the subjects that I had studied in the past were built on a logic that could be sussed out if one was willing to spend the time.  For example, when given a formula in let's say Cosmology, certain mathematical and scientific principles are in play.  So given enough time and effort, I could simply reason out a better understanding and then eventually the correct understand.  It was an issue of closing a Logic gap and not a Knowledge gap.</p>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">I how found that this method needs retooling for portions of programming.  In most cases for coding it is a Knowledge gap and not a Logic gap, but I am applying the same approach.  One can sit for hours, days, weeks, even and still not logic-out .reduce from thin air.  That is why I am calling it a Knowledge gap.  I need to Google more often ask others in my cohort more questions.  I believe that this will close the Knowledge gap and make me a more efficient and effective programmer.  Of course, I will gain logic from studying Google and discussing coding issues with my cohort.  I didn't focus on this, because the other is the struggle.</p>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">As noted by a follow Boot, I also tend to get off the road and into the weeds.  I naturally do this, because it is part of how I learn effectively.  It is part of my learning style.  I have also gained over the past 8 weeks an increased ability to understand HOW to use a piece of code and USE it without going in as much depth now.  This Boot mentioned that they love my interest and curiosity, they see that I get in the weeds because I want to know more, however there is a time to deliver bug-free "good enough" code rather than "Chandler Smith Certified" code.  This comment was insightful, very helpful, as well as, humorous.</p>

		<h3>Plan of Action</h3>

		<p id="body_paragraphs">Keep the GOAL in mind.  What are we trying to accomplish and to what level of perfection?</p>
		<p id="body_paragraphs">Remind myself that bug-free "good enough" code is more useful than code not delivered (There is a time to ship.)</p>
		<p id="body_paragraphs">Stay active on thinking, but knowing when to Google (This time is much sooner than I normally would in the past.)</p>
		<p id="body_paragraphs">Stay focused on Logic gap vs Knowledge gap and work on the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
		<p id="body_paragraphs">Rely on the growth mindset aspects of my personality to encourage myself in times that are scary to move forward and grow.</p>
		<p id="body_paragraphs">Remember that we are all here to improve ourselves and contribute to and rely on the other Boots.</p>
