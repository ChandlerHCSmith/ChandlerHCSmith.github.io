## U3.W9: Design Your Own DATABASE 

####I worked on this challenge [by myself].


### Release 5: Reflection

How to Reflect
Reflecting is an incredibly important part of the learning process. It requires you to take a moment and think about what you've learned, what is confusing, and where you need to go. They document your learning process.

Reflections are mandatory for each challenge.

When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking.

Remember, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates to learn from, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

1)  What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?

It was really cool to design tables and CREATE them from the Command Line and then see their schema and their contents.  I was also quite enjoyable to SELECT different columns of information from each table.      

2)  What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

When I first ran my SELECT/JOIN statements, I was receiving the following: "Error: ambiguous column name: vendor_id."  So, I looked this directly up in Google and found an answer on the following websites:  http://databases.aspfaq.com/database/what-does-ambiguous-column-name-mean.html      

3)  What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

I was having troubles using JOIN in a SELECT statement to extract the desired data.  Now, it extracts only correct data, however it does not extract all data.  I am reasearching why.     

4)  Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I learned vendor.vendor_id.  I learned that table.key is a method of stating explicitly which key is being referred to.   

5)  How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I am confident about creating databases from the command line, about INSERTing data into these tables, about using simple SELECT statements to extract data from these tables, about using more complex SELECT/WHERE/JOIN/ORDER BY/GROUP BY statements to extract data from these tables.  Picking Primary Keys and Foreign Keys seems to make sense, but I like to see the loop holes and pitfalls of certain choices.

6)  Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I really thought it was cool creating tables from the command line and then being able to access data from these tables.       

7)  Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I really didn't find any part of this challenge to be tedious.  I am still wanting a better understanding of JOIN as mentioned in 5).
