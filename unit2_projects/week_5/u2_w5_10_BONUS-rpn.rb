#  Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

#  	I started with this challenge first, since it appears at the top of the list.
# 	I read it over and went off to work thinking about RPN.  This was Monday, Day 1 of Week 5.

#  	When I came home I read the 1_die challenge and saw the solution quickly, so I worked the 1_die challenge out.
# 	This took me in the direction of working on challenge 2 and then 3 and so on.  I had more family committments this
# 	week than normal and by Friday I noticed the word BONUS and thought of it as an Optional assignment as DBC sometimes
# 	has.

# 	I wanted to work out the answer and still will next week if this is okay.

#  	I only became aware that this must not be optional when my submission page would not advance.
